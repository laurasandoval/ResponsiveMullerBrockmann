## Who is that [Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann](https://www.google.com/search?q=Josef+M%C3%BCller-Brockmann+work&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwij7MSblPrpAhWqILkGHQVyCisQ_AUoAXoECA4QAw&biw=1792&bih=961)
Quoting [GraphÃ©ine](https://www.grapheine.com/en/history-of-graphic-design/graphic-designer-muller-brockmann-swiss-style):
> The father of Swiss graphic design  
>  
> MÃ¼ller-Brockmann is probably one of the most influential graphic designers in the history of our profession. His work is always taught, studied and published. It is certainly the figurehead of Swiss graphic design (which also takes the name of international style). His work is influenced by Bauhaus and constructivism. Typography and geometry are predominant. His compositions are based on very "rigid" grids which will be his trademark. An economical and rational style.

So he basically knows a bit or two about grids (he actually wrote [a really interesting book](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Josef-MÃ¼ller-Brockmann/dp/3721201450) about them).

## About this project
I'm a big CSS grid evangelistâ„¢, but I realized I didn't have much experience exploring it in non-work related projects, so I though I might as well do!

I chose to play around with MÃ¼ller's graphic design work because of it's very peculiar grids and heavy reliance on typography.
